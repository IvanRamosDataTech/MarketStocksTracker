## Dependency Management
Project uses Poetry as dependency management. Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution.

1. If pipx is not already installed, you can follow any of the options in the [official website](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).

2. Run 
> pipx install poetry

3. Upgrade poetry 
> pipx upgrade poetry


Instead of creating a new project, POetry can be used to initialise a pre-populated directory. (Project setup was already done by running > poetry new marketstockstracker(must be same name as project's root directory ). This will automatically create a new virtual environment for your project and going to store it at username\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs

> poetry init

then to install the defined dependencies for you project, just run 

> poetry install

updater scripts helps to keep up with last changes from portfolio, gets a snapshot of last portfolio positions and bulks it into Postgresql database. To run this scrip, simply type (inside marketstockstracker/tracker-poetry-src/tracker_poetry)
> poetry run python updater.py

If you need an additional library, all you have to do is run next command (inside )
> poetry add _libraryName_

## Managing environment with Poetry commands

Poetry makes project environment isolation one of its core features.
By default, Poetry will try to use the Python version used during Poetryâ€™s installation to create the virtual environment for the current project.

By default, poetry will use associated virtual environment at the moment project was installed, you  can see that env by

> poetry env info

You can also list all the virtual environments associated with the current project with the command

> poetry env list

If you project has more than one virtual environment associated, then  you can switch between venvs by

> poetry env use _full/path/to/python_

Finally, you can delete existing virtual environments by using  (You can also use virtual env name provided by poetry env info ), or use flag to remove all environments

> poetry env remove _full/path/to/python_ | _cache_env_name_ | --all

To remove currently activated virtual environment

> poetry env remove
